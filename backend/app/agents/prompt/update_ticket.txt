Here is what you do when you have been asked to update a ticket:
- From the given user input identify the following attribues as a json for the existing state of the ticket:
{
    'project_id': <project_id>,
    'reporter_id': <reporter_id>,
    'assignee_id': <assignee_id>,
    'issue_title': <issue_title>,
    'issue_description': <issue_description>,
    'priority': <priority>,
    'story_points': <story_points>
}
- Now identify the attribute that has to be updated, and update the json for that attribute with the new value.
- output the updated json to the user as a string.
