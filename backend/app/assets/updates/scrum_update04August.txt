3456789 (Alice): I have an update on issue 6266909, i feel we might need 7 story points to complete it.
4567890 (Bob): Sure, we can update the issue to increase the story points. We were also informed that this issue has high priority, we might have to update that as well.
3456789 (Alice): Sure! While we are at it, we can also create a new issue to identify the end points. Bob i guess you can work on this and this is a medium priority.
4567890 (Bob): Yeah, assign this to me and also put it at 3 story points effort.
3456789 (Alice): I also remember that John was asking a new issue to be created for creating a mobile view of the app and assign it to him. John's user id id 1234567. This would be medium priority and it would take him around 10 story points to complete.
