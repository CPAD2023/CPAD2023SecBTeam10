# autoScrum


### About Assignment:
Group: B10 

Assignement Description: 
- The motivation for this tool comes from daily scrum calls. Teams gather around to first discuss issues, updates and blockers and then the developers, scrum masters and the product owners will have to update the respective issues or tickets with the details of the scrum calls.
- It also becomes necessary for these individuals to track every issue ever created, to prevent duplicate issues from being created or link existing issues to new issues.
- Also defining the done criteria for each issue according to organization standards is an issue.
- We have created this autoScrum application that will allow users to specify the details of the product, scrum practices as the context to the agent and ask the agent to perform several tasks such as creating, updating and deleting issues.
- The agent is also capable of processing example transcripts from meetings to identify tasks and perform them, making it easier for users to process scrum documents.
